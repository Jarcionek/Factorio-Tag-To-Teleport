- travelled distance print is not useful, especially when travelling to saved location, make it configurable

- teleportation capsule
    - to click in the world to teleport there
    - capsule type with huge range?
    - shortcut to get it

- on teleport, remember the player location and allow to teleport back there
    - shortcut?




add gui with teleport buttons, for deletion, rather than playing with confirmation windows etc., it might just open a map at that location instead
- or maybe even no map move - just teleport there and open a map, which will open at player location

once above is done, remove the default key mappings?

adding gui would allow to remove the constraint of first char being a digit, but what to do with keyboard shortcuts then?




when changing existing tag without a name and giving it a teleport tag, I was expecting to be teleported there and tag to disappear, but instead I got an error "invalid teleport location name"
what should the behaviour be?




refactoring - split the control.lua into multiple files
