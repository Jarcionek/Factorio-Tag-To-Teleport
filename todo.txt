!!! REMOVE THIS FILE FROM THE BRANCH BEFORE MERGING TO MASTER AND LEAVE IT ON "workinprogress" BRANCH !!!

add gui with teleport buttons, for deletion, rather than playing with confirmation windows etc., it might just open a map at that location instead
- or maybe even no map move - just teleport there and open a map, which will open at player location

once above is done, remove the default key mappings?

adding gui would allow to remove the constraint of first char being a digit, but what to do with keyboard shortcuts then?



move changelog to readme?



when changing existing tag without a name and giving it a teleport tag, I was expecting to be teleported there and tag to disappear, but instead I got an error "invalid teleport location name"
what should the behaviour be?


travelled distance print is not useful, especially when travelling to saved location, make it configurable?



shortcut to teleport to current position in the Zoom to World view?
it's not possible to get a position of that so I would have to attach on_entity_selected listener and TP to last known position instead
or create a capsule item and ask the user to click there....



refactoring - split the control.lua into multiple files
